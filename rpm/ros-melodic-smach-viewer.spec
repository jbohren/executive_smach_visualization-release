%description
The smach viewer is a GUI that shows the state of hierarchical SMACH state
machines. It can visualize the possible transitions between states, as well as
the currently active state and the values of user data that is passed around
between states. The smach viewer uses the SMACH debugging interface based on the
smach messages to gather information from running state machines.
